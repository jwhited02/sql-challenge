This is my Module 9 Challenge!




For this challenge, I am a a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. I was tasked with designing the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answering questions about the data. 



The questions are: 


1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).



The SQL files containing the schema for the tables and queries for these questions can be found in the "SQL Files" folder. 

The .png of the ERD can be found in the "ERD" folder. 

The .csv files can be found in the "Resources" folder. 



First, I formed the schemas based off the .csv files given. Once I got all of those to run smoothly and in the correct order, I did the queries based off of the solved class activities from the SQL days. Most of them were pretty simple and I didn't have many issues with those. To make sure the schema and queries ran smoothly, I used pgAdmin and was finally able to get it to work. I had some problems uploading the data to the tables, and it turns out I just needed to upload them in the correct order. Once I found out that was the issue I felt pretty dumb, but I am glad it was something as simple as that.



Thank you for taking the time to grade my assignment!
